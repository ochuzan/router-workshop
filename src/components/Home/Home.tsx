    <h2>Welcome to the Caves of Wonder</h2>
    <p>In this journey, your browser will be your guide.</p>
    <p>
      The goal of the cave Adventure is to explore a series of interconnected
      caverns find your way to the deepest section - you'll know you've found
      the deepest cavern because there will be a message indicating such
      inscribed on the cave wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you click the "Caves" button, you'll have the option to enter into
      the first cavern, and from there you'll have to make choices about the
      route you take to find your way to the goal. As you lower yourself further
      into the caves, you can climb back up to the previous cavern with the
      "back" button, so feel free to do just that if you ever find yourself at a
      dead end.
